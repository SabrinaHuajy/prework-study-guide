# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for building this project is to help bootcamp students. This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It solves the problem for first-day coders who need an idea to start their coding journey. I personally learned the joy of coding form this project. I begin to feel that I don't have to precieve the bugs as frustrations and failures, it could be little game leads to the next surprise fun. Maybe it's the same for life, we always have the choice to manifest it in a different way.
